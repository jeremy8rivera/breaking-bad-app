1. We would like you to use the Breaking Bad API https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to read and display the Characters List in an organized way. 

2. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. 

3. The code should be "production ready" including test cases and a Readme file for how to run.

If you'd like to substitute the Breaking Bad API with another source you're more passionate about, please feel free to. Your data source should include a list of content with the same goals. Here's a great list of public APIs:

Here are a couple that might work well:

 - https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api
 - https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/01-listbreweries

Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.
